# Housing-Price-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-Model

Hi, this repository is for the project on predicting housing prices using the Boston Dataset that can be found on kaggle.

Boston Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing

The fastai library was used. To install fastai:

pip install fastai

To run the notebook, first save the training and test data from the kaggle website into the data folder found in the fastai directory.

I have written a medium article discussing my though process and analysis of the project. It can be accessed via the link: https://medium.com/@santoshyadawprl/predicting-housing-prices-using-a-scikit-learns-random-forest-model-e736b59d56c5
